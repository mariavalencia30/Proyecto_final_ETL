      "content": "\"Roar\" is the lead single off Katy Perry's third album, PRISM and was released on August 12, 2013.\n\nIt reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on September 5 and stayed at the top for a total of two weeks, becoming Perry's eighth #1 on the Hot 100, and it currently has more than 3,9 billion views on Youtube being the most viewed female music video on the platform.\n\nThe song is a bouncy statement by Perry of moving forward into the next stage of her life after the tumultuous end of her marriage to Russell Brand. Talking to BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, she revealed: \"It's a bit of a self-empowering type of song. I wrote it because I was sick of keeping all these feelings inside and not speaking up for myself, which caused a lot of resentment. Obviously I've been through a lot of therapy since my last record and that's what this is about\".\n\nFour words that Sylvester Stallone came up with in the early '80s permeated pop culture through the decades, landing (in very derivative fashion) in this song. When Perry sings about having the \"eye of the tiger\", it's a mantra of courage and determination that Stallone's character, Rocky Balboa, used in the 1982 movie Rocky III to defeat Mr. T's character Clubber Lang. Stallone saw the youth appeal in the phrase, and asked the band Survivor to write a song around the title. The first two Rocky movies were aimed at adults, but this third one, with a fresh, contemporary theme song, gained a whole new audience primed by MTV. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/Roar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
