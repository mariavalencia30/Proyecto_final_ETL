It is styled as a \"Broadway hip-hop musical\" and features a flash mob as well as American dance crew the Jabbawockeez. James Rico, the head of the production team Reel Goats, stated that he was inspired by the intro sequences of Austin Powers and how people would want to dance around the title character. Rico went on to say that he wanted to recreate that same feeling of community in the music video, drawing additional inspiration from Rocky, with the end goal being a \"rap version of\" the intro scene from La La Land. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/DaBaby/_/BOP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
