      "summary": "\"Bad Blood\" is about the end of a friendship or romantic relationship. It discusses how even though things were once very good between two people, deep betrayal and a broken trust has caused a rift that may be too difficult to mend. The chorus suggests that the person the song is directed at may be feeling regretful, while the verses and pre-choruses point to persistent hurt and resentment that speaks to a much deeper grudge. The bridge emphasizes how even apologies are not enough to repair the damage that has been done. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Bad+Blood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
