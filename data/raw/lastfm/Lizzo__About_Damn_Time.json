      "content": "\"About Damn Time\" is a song Recorded by American singer and rapper Lizzo released on April 14, 2022 by Atlantic Records as the lead single to Lizzo's fourth studio album Special\n\n-- What Lizzo Says 'About Damn Time': \nI made the song of the summer with “About Damn Time”. I’m in my bag, and my bag is music. I’m good at music. It’s what I do.\n\n“About Damn Time” can lead into so many conversations. It’s about damn time I feel better, it’s about damn time we get out this pandemic. It’s about damn time we to get the first black female Supreme Court Justice. There’s so many things. It’s about damn time we popped the champagne. It’s about damn time the tequila got here.\n\nI have to give props to Ricky [Reed] and Blake Slatkin. I was in my diva bag on this one, because I thought I was done with my album, Zane. I was like, “I’m done, no more songs.” Then they were like, “Yo, we think we got something,” and I was like, “I ain’t coming to the studio unless it’s a hit.” They played a track, I heard the track, and I was like, “I’ll be there in 10 minutes.” You know what I’m saying? When I got there, the idea is disco was revolutionary for a lot of people, disco and funk. This was intentionally disco, funk, something to walk to coming out of this dark time. This was intentional, the genre of music. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lizzo/_/About+Damn+Time\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
