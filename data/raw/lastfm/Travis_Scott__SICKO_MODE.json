It was originally released by Epic Records on August 3, 2018, as the third track from ASTROWORLD before being released as the second single on August 21. It features additional uncredited vocals by fellow American rappers Swae Lee and the late Big Hawk.\n\nThe song was Scott's first number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 (although Drake is not credited on the Billboard charts), as well as the first hip-hop song in history to spend at least 30 weeks in the chart's top ten regions. It was universally acclaimed by critics and received nominations for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nThe song contains a sample from “Gimme the Loot”, written by The Notorious B.I.G. and Easy Mo Bee, as performed by the former, and an interpolation from “I Wanna Rock”, written and performed by Uncle Luke. On December 9, 2020, the song was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/SICKO+MODE\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
