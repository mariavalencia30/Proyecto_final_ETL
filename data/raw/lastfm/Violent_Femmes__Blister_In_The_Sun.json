      "content": "\"Blister in the Sun\" is a song by American rock band Violent Femmes, originally released on their 1983 self-titled debut album.\n\nIn 2005, it became the first English-language track to ever be allowed on RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, the Republic of Ireland Irish-language radio station, after having been selected by listeners for the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn media \n\n\nThe song was also featured prominently in the 1997 film Grosse Pointe Blank. John Cusack had initially requested an updated version of the song, which led to the band recording a new, slower arrangement that featured saxophones, strings and other instruments. This version of the song was dubbed \"Blister 2000.\" However, Cusack eventually decided he wanted to include the original version of the song as well. Because the original master tapes of the band's debut album had long been disposed of, they decided to record a new version of the original 1983 arrangement. Neither of these rerecorded versions appears in the actual film, although a new music video, directed by Evan Bernard, was created for the new recording of the 1983 arrangement. It features Gordon Gano as a deranged assassin trying to kill Socks the cat in puppet form, interspersed with clips from the film.\n\nIn August 2007, Gordon Gano was the subject of a lawsuit brought by bassist Brian Ritchie. The lawsuit stems partly from Gano's authorization of the use of \"Blister\" in a Wendy's commercial. In 2008, the song was featured on a Foster's Lager \"Stealing Shadows\" advertisement.\n\n\n\"Blister in the Sun\"\nSong by Violent Femmes\nfrom the album Violent Femmes\nReleased\t1983\nGenre\tFolk punk[1]\nLength\t2:27\nLabel\tSlash\nSongwriter(s)\tGordon Gano\nProducer(s)\tMark Van Hecke <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Violent+Femmes/_/Blister+In+The+Sun\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
