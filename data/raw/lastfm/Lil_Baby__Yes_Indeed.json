So I was like, ‘Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu.’ But I was talking about his car. And we went on with it.\n\nThe single’s cover, a re-elaboration of the Ferrari official logo, recalls the theme present in both Drake and Lil Baby’s verses. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Baby/_/Yes+Indeed\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
