It was originally recorded in 1997, but extended and released as a single in 2018. A remix with Pitbull and Karol G was released on August 29, 2018.\n\nThe song was first released on El Chombo's album \"Cuentos de la Cripta II\" as a short version under the title \"Introduccion B (El Cosita Mix)\". A remix of the song titled \"Cosita Mix (New Mix)\" was released in 2001 on the album Cuentos de la Cripta Remixes, in which the 2018 version is based on.\n\nFollowing the song's viral Internet popularity, French record label Juston Records signed El Chombo and commissioned an extended version of the track. The label also acquired the rights to ArtNoux's video and requested a new video for the extended track.\n\nUltra Music acquired the worldwide distribution rights to the new, extended song and music video. In April 2018, the music video was uploaded to Ultra's YouTube channel, and its popularity skyrocketed. The track was released as a single soon after, which debuted at No. 81 on the Billboard Hot 100, eventually reaching a peak of No. 36.\n\nA remix featuring Pitbull and Karol G was released on August 24, 2018, and was produced by El Chombo and Afro Bros. The remix charted at No. 1 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, which serves as an extension to the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached No. 31 on the Billboard Argentina Hot 100. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/El+Chombo/_/Dame+tu+Cosita\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
