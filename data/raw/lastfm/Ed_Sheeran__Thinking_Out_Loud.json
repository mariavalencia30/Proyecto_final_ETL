He calls it the only happy song on the album x, on which he strived for a more serious vibe, working extensively with Rick Rubin.\n\nSheeran co-wrote “Thinking Out Loud” with Welsh folk singer Amy Wadge, and his friend and long-time collaborator Jake Gosling produced the track. Chris Leonard engineered it, and played guitar.\n\nThe bass and drums are very close to Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On\"—Sheeran has even mixed a little of the \"Let’s Get It On” lyrics into his life performances <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran/_/Thinking+Out+Loud\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
