      "content": "On “Ransom,” Lil Tecca shares some braggadocious lines about his newfound fame and the lifestyle it implies—he boasts about his luxury vehicles, designer clothes and his women.\n\nThe track was long-awaited by fans as it was previewed multiple times by the artist throughout his social medias before its initial release on May 22, 2019. The track released alongside a music video, directed by Cole Bennett of Lyrical Lemonade.\n\n\"When I recorded “Ransom,” I was in L.A. It was probably 11:00, I think, and I heard the beat. I heard the beat drop. I was like, “Whoa. Yeah, this is in a whole different universe.” I wrote that song just line by line, but the whole concept of it was just freestyle, but I just put words to it. That was the last song I did there. After that, I freestyled everything. I started freestyling on my songs after I seen Juice WRLD do it. Then, I was like, “This is hard.” Then, I just tried and then made a few songs out of it that I like, and I kept trying it.\"\n\n\"I don’t know how I even came up with that name. I just kept writing. Then, usually, I don’t pick the name of the song until after the song, so I kept going, I kept listening to it, “What should I name it? What should I name it?” And then I heard me say “ransom” and I was just like, “Ransom.” Yeah.\"\n\n\"“Ransom,” was inspired by just I don’t care what no one else thinks. You feel me? I don’t care what no one thinks anymore. I’m just going to do me now. You feel me? If people like it, they like it. If they don’t, they don’t. I like it.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Tecca/_/Ransom\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
