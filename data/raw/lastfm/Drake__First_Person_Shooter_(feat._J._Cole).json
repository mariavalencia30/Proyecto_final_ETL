      "content": "On the two-part track “First Person Shooter,” Drake reunites with his “Jodeci Freestyle” collaborator, J. Cole, for a hype track in which both artists discuss their current status in the rap industry.\n\nDrake talks about his successful lifestyle, from being close to surpassing the most successful artist in history, Michael Jackson, after the release of the album’s lead single, “Slime You Out”, debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, to how he compares himself to be “bigger” than a Super Bowl concert/game — he also mentions his murderous and luxury lifestyle around the two verses he raps.\n\nOn the other hand, Cole discusses how other rappers use his name as a form of “beef” to create an alleged rivalry with him to generate some benefit from it — while he also talks about his status in the rap game due to the critical acclaim of his albums, his historic features runs and his extravagant productions, which leave him being considered as one of the great rappers of the current generation along with Kendrick Lamar and Drake himself.\n\nThis collaboration was highly anticipated by many fans, being that it was anticipated on any Drake album; from appearing on Honestly, Nevermind cut, “Jimmy Cooks” as a cameo to being expected to feature on his collaborative album with 21 Savage, Her Loss, in the large majority of 2022.\n\nDuring Drake’s tour stop in Montreal in July 2023, he brought Cole out as a special guest performer, with Drake implying that the two had a collaboration on the way.\n\nOn October 5, 2023, J. Cole’s involvement in the song was confirmed on Drake’s Table for One show on Sound 42, hours prior to the release of his highly-anticipated album, For All The Dogs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/First+Person+Shooter+(feat.+J.+Cole)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
