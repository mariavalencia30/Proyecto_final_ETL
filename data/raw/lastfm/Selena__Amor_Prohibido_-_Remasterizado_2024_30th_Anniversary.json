Having reached a core fan base, the label aimed to broaden her appeal with the next studio release. Finding it challenging to write a follow-up hit after \"Como la Flor\" (1992), Selena's brother A. B. Quintanilla enlisted the assistance from band members Ricky Vela and Pete Astudillo with writing the album's songs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Selena/_/Amor+Prohibido+-+Remasterizado+2024%2F30th+Anniversary\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
      "content": "Amor Prohibido (English: Forbidden Love) is the fourth studio album by American singer Selena, released on March 22, 1994, by EMI Latin. Having reached a core fan base, the label aimed to broaden her appeal with the next studio release. Finding it challenging to write a follow-up hit after \"Como la Flor\" (1992), Selena's brother A. B. Quintanilla enlisted the assistance from band members Ricky Vela and Pete Astudillo with writing the album's songs. The resulting album has a more mature sound featuring experimental production that blends diverse musical styles from ranchera to hip-hop music. Amor Prohibido is a Tejano cumbia album modernized with a synthesizer-rich delivery using a minimalist style that was quintessential in early 1990s Tejano music. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Selena/_/Amor+Prohibido+-+Remasterizado+2024%2F30th+Anniversary\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
