The official music video was released alongside the song on March 3, 2021.\n\nStylistically, the song diverges from the more acoustic sound of Maroon 5’s previous two singles, “Memories” and “Nobody’s Love”. This shift to the song’s trap-pop sound is likely due to the co-writing from alternative pop artist blackbear and frequent collaborator Andrew Goldstein. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5/_/Beautiful+Mistakes+(feat.+Megan+Thee+Stallion)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
