      "content": "On “Way 2 Sexy,” Drake enlists frequent collaborators Future and Young Thug, who previously united on the track “D4L” from Drake’s May 2020 mixtape Dark Lane Demo Tapes, for a sexually charged male empowerment anthem.\n\nThe song features production from TM88, who previously worked with Drake on the 2015 track “Company” featuring Travis Scott, as well as up-and-coming producer TooDope, marking his first collaboration with Drake.\n\nOn the song’s chorus, Future pays homage to British group Right Said Fred, interpolating lyrics from their 1991 hit “I’m Too Sexy,” which is also sampled throughout the song.\n\nPrior to its release, fans speculated that “Way 2 Sexy” would be released as the second single for Certified Lover Boy following 2020’s “Laugh Now Cry Later” after a behind-the-scenes video surfaced of the trio filming visuals for the track in July 2021. Ultimately, the song’s accompanying music video was released on September 4, 2021, to coincide with Certified Lover Boy’s release.\n\nThe music video includes references to the Pirates of the Caribbean and Rambo franchises, Michael Jackson’s 1991 “Black or White,” Prince and The New Power Generation’s 1992 “Sexy M. F.,” and the Backstreet Boys’ 1999 “I Want It That Way” (which also features a cameo by Kawhi Leonard). It also shows Drake as an ’80s-style workout instructor and beach dad, along with Thugger in a calendar photo shoot and other animated characters.\n\n“Way 2 Sexy” debuted at #1 on Rolling Stone’s Top 100 Songs Chart during the week ending September 9, 2021. It also debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week ending September 18, 2021. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Way+2+Sexy+(with+Future+&+Young+Thug)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
