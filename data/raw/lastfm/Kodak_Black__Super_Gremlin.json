      "content": "“Super Gremlin” is one of the more notable songs on the Sniper Gang sophomore compilation record, Sniper Gang Presents: Nightmare Babies. The title of the track represents Kodak’s grimy and scandalous personality.\n\nThroughout the lyrics, Kodak alludes to fellow Sniper Gang rappers and frequent collaborators, Jackboy. Kodak describes how the two could have been superstars, and reminisces on memories saying that somebody switched up.\n\nUsing the melody of “Errror,” producers Jambo and ATL Jacob pitch the voice of How To Loot Brazil higher to outline the intro and to guide the chorus; ultimately delivering a relaxed sound, contradicting the gritty lyrics Kodak raps.\n\nDays after the release of the audio, on November 1, 2021, the official music video—directed by Andre Rene—was released. The video starred Kodak and Nepthys the Goddess; the latter wearing a costume and make-up that resembles a gremlin.\n\nOn January 11, 2022, after the soaring success the song received, it was re-released for urban contemporary radio use.\n\nThe song was later placed on Yak’s fourth studio album, Back For Everything. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kodak+Black/_/Super+Gremlin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
