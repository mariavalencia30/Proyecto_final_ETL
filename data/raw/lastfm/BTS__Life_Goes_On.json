      "content": "\"Life Goes On\" is a song by BTS. It is the first and title track off their fifth studio album 'BE'. It was released on November 20, 2020, along with its music video.\n\nThis nostalgic song blurs alternative hip-hop sound with acoustic guitar and synth-pop. The lyrics offer comfort in a time when the world faces the pandemic.\nThe story behind the song begins from BTS  declaring that “even in the face of this new normality, our life goes on and imparts a message of healing to fans and to the world.”\n\nThe theme “life goes on” was mentioned several times while BTS shared the process behind the album through vlogs over the months.\n“Life goes on, let’s live on” was also the main message of their speech at the 75th UN General Assembly, given just a few months before the song release. The group appeared there as they’ve worked previously with UNICEF on the “LOVE MYSELF” campaign, this time giving the message of “let’s live on in a new world, breaking free from despair and supporting one another in warm solidarity.”\n\n\"Life Goes On\" debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, on the chart issue dated December 5, 2020, becoming BTS' third number-one single in the United States in exactly three months, following random people in the streets of Chicago in September and \"Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat) (BTS Remix)\" in October. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/BTS/_/Life+Goes+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
