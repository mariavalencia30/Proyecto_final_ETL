A song that praises the feeling and comfort of solidarity. When I started making music it was never about to be any (particular), but about creating something for others who could enjoy it with me. What I have experienced by making music and sharing it with (others) are stunning.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Walker/_/Alone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
