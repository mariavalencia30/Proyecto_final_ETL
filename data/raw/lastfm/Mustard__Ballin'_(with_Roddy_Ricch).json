      "content": "Compton native Roddy Ricch and Los Angeles native Mustard finally link up for their first collaboration. The West Coast collaboration was bound to happen, just like Roddy Ricch’s unique style was bound to be successful. Just like on “Ballin'” and Ricch’s solo songs, he has not had to change his sound or his material to make it big.\n\nThe Compton rapper keeps it real on “Ballin',” sharing details about his come up, as well as some of the things he’s been lucky enough to buy since he’s made money in music. It’s important to note that Mustard placed “Ballin'” right before the closing track of Perfect Ten, the title track that features the late Nipsey Hussle.\n\nOn Wednesday, October 2, 2019, Mustard released the video for “Ballin'” on his YouTube channel continuing to push the song not long after the song hit the radio, only making it bigger. The video is very much a tribute to Nipsey, while still allowing Mustard and Roddy Ricch to ball out.\n\nDuring the week ending January 18, 2020, “Ballin'” peaked at #11 on the Hot 100. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mustard/_/Ballin%27+(with+Roddy+Ricch)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
