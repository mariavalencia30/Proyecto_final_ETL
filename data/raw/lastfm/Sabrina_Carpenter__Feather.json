Incorporating electric piano, piano, synthesizer, kick, and bass in its instrumentation, the song's lyrics detail blocking someone on social media and feeling like a burden has been lifted after leaving them behind: \"I got you blocked / After this, an afterthought / I finally cut you off / I feel so much lighter, like a feather with you off my mind.\"\n\nIsland Records released its sped-up version for digital download and streaming on August 4, 2023. A music video for the song was released on October 31, 2023. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sabrina+Carpenter/_/Feather\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
