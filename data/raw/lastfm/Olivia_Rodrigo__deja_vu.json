      "content": "\"Deja Vu\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song by American singer Olivia Rodrigo. It was released through Geffen and Interscope Records on April 1, 2021, as the second single from Rodrigo's debut studio album,  SOUR. The song was announced on her website and via her social media accounts on March 29, 2021.[1] The song serves as a follow-up to her globally successful debut single, \"Drivers License\".\n\nRodrigo began teasing a follow-up single by wiping her Instagram account and posting cryptic teasers of it on her social media accounts in late March 2021; on March 29, she announced that it would be titled \"Deja Vu\", and set a release date of three days later, reassuring fans that the announcement was not an April Fools' Day joke. Rodrigo unveiled the song's artwork in the same post. Rodrigo posted three cryptic flickering clips preceding the announcement, featuring a melting ice cream cone, drifting clouds, and a car being driven along the ocean, which was interpreted as a reference to \"Deja Vu\"'s lyrics by Nylon's Steffanee Wang. In an interview with MTV News, Rodrigo stated that the song was \"definitely not like 'Drivers License' at all\", and was excited and nervous about her audience viewing a different aspect of her artistry on it.[9] Furthermore, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Rodrigo mentioned that the song's bridge was influenced by \"Cruel Summer\", a song featured on Taylor Swift's seventh studio album, Lover. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Olivia+Rodrigo/_/deja+vu\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
