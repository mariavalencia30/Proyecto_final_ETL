On the same day, a teaser billboard from Spotify teases a new song from Drake that seemingly ties in with the diss track. The track was officially released on streaming on April 19, 2024. The cover art depicts a shoe-size label for a men’s size 7 shoe, notably the size of Kendrick’s shoes, as referenced in the track (How you big-steppin’ with a size 7 men's on?). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Push+Ups\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
