It is the lead single from Thug’s 2019 project, presumably titled GØŁDMØÜFDÖG, and his first official release since his September 2018 EP, On the Rvn.\n\nThe single was first teased on May 11, 2019, when flyers were thrown out to attendees of Thug’s set at Miami’s Rolling Loud Festival. They featured the first line of Thug’s verse on the track and teased the song’s artwork and color scheme.\n\nThe song was teased again on May 21, 2019, during a since-deleted live stream on Thug’s YouTube channel titled “Meet Me At The London,” which spanned over the course of more than twelve hours. The live stream focused on a woman painting a spider on a green canvas, again foreshadowing the song’s artwork. Travis' involvement was also teased by a woman filling a cactus-shaped piñata with candy.\n\n“The London” received an official release two days later with less than an hour’s notice. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Young+Thug/_/The+London+(feat.+J.+Cole+&+Travis+Scott)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
