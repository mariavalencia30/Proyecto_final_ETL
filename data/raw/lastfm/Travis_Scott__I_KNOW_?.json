      "content": "In “I KNOW ?,” Travis Scott portrays an image of what life is like for him when he does drugs and drinks alcohol, suggesting he’s tainted and bothered by everyone looking out for him.\n\nIn the chorus, the heavy repetition of, “I know” suggests that Travis is feeling fed up and bothered by everyone judging him for being on drugs, however, because he’s so addicted, despite people caring for him, he brushes it off as though he feels they’re not looking out for him.\n\nThe track shares a similar cadence to Travis' August 2018, “5% TINT” which similarly has a slow, yet fascinating rhythm. While rapping, Travis is backed by a creepy piano riff that follows him through the entire track.\n\nWith a lack of autotune — in comparison to other Travis Scott songs — the raw vocals play into the mysterious theme of the song which surrounds the topic of drugs. It sees Travis being honest, however, at the same time, he’s in denial about being on drugs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/I+KNOW+%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
