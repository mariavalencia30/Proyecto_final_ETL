Made for the soundtrack of Amazon Prime Video's television series Invincible, the song was released through Darkroom and Interscope Records on March 28, 2024. It is a funk track in which D4vd sings about being certain that his love interest is right for him.\n\nDd4vd was a fan of the television series Invincible before he became involved in its soundtrack. After becoming friends with the show's music supervisor, Gabe Hifler, d4vd wrote \"Feel It\" in one day. For recording, they watched a scene including two characters, Mark Grayson and his love interest, Amber Bennett, and wanted to give the feeling that the characters were listening to the song in the show, believing it would be \"more natural\".\n\n\"Feel It\" is a funk track built around a \"heavy bass line\" and \"notable guitar riffs\", described by Uproxx as a \"groovy and upbeat tune\". Lyrically, d4vd sings about a woman whom he is sure he wants to be with, and does not want to lose. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/d4vd/_/Feel+It\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
