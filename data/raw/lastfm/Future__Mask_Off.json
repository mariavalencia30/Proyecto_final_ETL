The song is also certified 8X platinum by the RIAA.\n\nThe song also spawned the #MaskOffChallenge, which participants dance and play instruments to the song. It was a huge factor in the song’s popularity.\n\n“Mask Off” was released along with the rest of FUTURE on February 17, 2017. It was later re-released as the album’s second single after it started receiving more popularity than “Draco,” the album’s lead single.\n\nA remix featuring Kendrick Lamar was released on May 23, 2017, and a Marshmello remix was released on June 16, 2017.\n\nThe song’s official music video was released on May 4, 2017, and two weeks later, on May 23, 2017, a remix featuring Kendrick Lamar was released. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Future/_/Mask+Off\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
