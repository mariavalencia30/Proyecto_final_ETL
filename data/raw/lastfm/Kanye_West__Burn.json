As 2023 progressed, it disappeared from tracklists of the album, including the first official one. The track leaked in its entirety on January 5, 2024, and seemingly because of so, Ye and Ty decided to finish it for the release of VULTURES 1. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/BURN\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
