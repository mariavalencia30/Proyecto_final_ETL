Instead, “Love On” captures the joy of flirting and finding new love.\n\nLyrically, “Love On” captures the feeling of finding a great connection—and gets a little risqué in its flirty verses. Gomez’s song offers a further hint into her headspace and journey getting into the love story she is in now. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Selena+Gomez/_/Love+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
