      "content": "\"death bed (coffee for your head)\", originally titled \"death bed\", is a song by Canadian recording artist Powfu, featuring Filipino-British singer-songwriter Beabadoobee. The song was initially uploaded to SoundCloud and YouTube in 2019; following Powfu signing to Columbia Records and Robots + Humans, the song was released on streaming services on February 8, 2020. The song samples the 2017 song \"Coffee\" by Beabadoobee, who is credited as a featured artist.\n\nThe song went viral on the video sharing app TikTok and through radio airplay in early 2020. On TikTok, the song had over 4.1 billion plays for the month of March alone and it peaked at #10 on the Mediabase charts. The radio edit of the song altered any lyric relating to death in the song and radio hosts would refer to the song as \"coffee for your head.\"\n\nOriginally released on the \"some boring, love stories, pt. 2\" EP in February 2019, the song's commercial release was delayed by a year due to the clearance of the sample of Beabadoobee's 2017 song \"Coffee\". Powfu said on Twitter in April 2019 that he had not put it on Spotify because he was \"scared [he'd] get in trouble from the sample [he] use in it\", but said he \"would upload it anyway\" and told his followers to give him \"a week and a half\". It was finally released to streaming and download services in February 2020. On May 28, 2020, a later version featured on his EP \"Poems of the Past\", which included the original version, was released featuring American pop punk band Blink-182. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Powfu/_/death+bed+(coffee+for+your+head)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
