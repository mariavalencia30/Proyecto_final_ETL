This subject matter has become a popular topic within Justin’s latest music, such as on 2015’s Purpose, and his latest feature, “Cold Water.”\n\nIn both verses, Justin details the struggles of their relationship, showing the issues among the couple. In verse 1, he sings about happy times in past tense, while verse 2 details his lover giving up on the relationship. The chorus acts as Justin’s plea to save the relationship, never giving up on their love.\n\nThe song is rumored to be about Justin’s ex-flame Selena Gomez, who teased the idea that she would be alongside DJ Snake and Justin Bieber after lip-syncing to a song with a similar chorus:\n\nEasily one of the most anticipated tracks on DJ Snake’s Encore, the French DJ and Canadian singer teased “Let Me Love You” for weeks leading up to the official release—even after it leaked alongside “Cold Water.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Snake/_/Let+Me+Love+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
