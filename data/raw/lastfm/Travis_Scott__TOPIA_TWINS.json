      "content": "“TOPIA TWINS,” track eleven on UTOPIA, sees Travis Scott alongside 21 Savage & Rob49 feeding into a false utopia. More specifically when he says:    \"Twin Bitches hoppin' off a jetski\"\n\nTravis seems to think that bringing these women to his hotel room will bring them closer to utopia, and that his surface level fantasies can fulfill his own fantasy. However, as exemplified in “CIRCUS MAXIMUS”, falling into the lifestyle of what is assumed from the public will only bring one to their own dystopia; on the surface it may seem they’ve reached peace, but it only brings torture to the soul.\n\nThis track’s title “TOPIA TWINS” contains an interesting omission of the letter “U” from utopia. It might be a subtle reference to false utopias and dystopias, meaning Travis is aware of his own shortcomings. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/TOPIA+TWINS\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
