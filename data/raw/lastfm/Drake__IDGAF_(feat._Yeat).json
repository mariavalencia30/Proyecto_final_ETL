However, Drake would seem to get a hold of the track after cosigning Yeat multiple times throughout 2023. The confirmation of Drake releasing the song would be through a Nike x NOCTA brand collab on September 13, 2023, which was later followed by an Instagram post by Drake with the caption stating:\n\n\"Music by Twizz and The Boy\"\n\"YEAT CARRY\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/IDGAF+(feat.+Yeat)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
