      "content": "In “Standing Next to You,” Jung Kook (정국) adopts the grand “us-against-the-world' mentality prevalent in many 2000s pop songs such as Westlife’s “You Raise Me Up” and Beyonce’s “Halo.” These simple yet powerful emotions are laid on top of this dramatic, jazz-funk, disco-pop instrumental that compliments the romantic retro aesthetic of the song.\n\nThe song’s lyrics express the strong feelings the narrator feels for a loved one from simply standing side-by-side with each other. There are also small easter eggs in the lyrics that seem to reference Jung Kook’s past solo songs and some past BTS projects.\n\nThe music video is a performance-dominated piece, with powerful and texture dynamic-heavy choreography that resembles the suave routines of the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. This strenuous choreography is performed throughout abandoned and warm-colored, usually golden-colored, scenery and sets.\n\nUkrainian model Pasha Harulia acts as Jung Kook’s female love interest in the M/V, adding some steamy tension to the video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jung+Kook/_/Standing+Next+to+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
