That’s the crazy part. I made it about a year ago. I just knew it was a vibe. I was like, ‘This is hard,’ and I knew I was going to give it to Future. Then he skipped it. But we were talking the other day when we were at Drake’s house, and he said he skipped it because he knew it was one of his favorites. He said he listened to that beat every day for a month straight, without rapping or nothing. He was just listening to the beat like it was a song for a month straight, and he knew what he was going to do to it.\n\nI didn’t even know he [laid the vocals down]. A long time went by like, six or seven months. So I was like, let me try the beat with another artist, since he ain’t like it. Then he called me and said, ‘Hey, don’t ever get this beat out to nobody else. I got a crazy song on it.’\"\n\nDuring the week ending May 4, 2022, “WAIT FOR U” debuted at #1 on the Hot 100. With this track, Drake earned his 10th song to top the chart and his sixth to debut at #1. It is the second #1 song for Future and the first for Tems.\n\nOn June 6, 2022, “WAIT FOR U” was certified platinum by the RIAA. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Future/_/WAIT+FOR+U+(feat.+Drake+&+Tems)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
