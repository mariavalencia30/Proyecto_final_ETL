      "content": "\"IT GIRL\" is the debut single by American social media personality Aliyah's Interlude. It was produced by Lxnely Beats and released on September 30, 2023, through Interlude Records. The pop-house song garnered success on TikTok upon its release and soundtracked more than 990,000 videos on the platform as of November 2023.\n\nBefore the release of \"IT GIRL\", Aliyah's Interlude had become popular on TikTok for her fashion style, which became known as AliyahCore. She was inspired by listening to Beyoncé's 2022 album Renaissance and her love of house music to \"hop on a house beat\". After finding one on YouTube, she recorded a rap over it and, after finding the Instagram account of its producer, Lxnely Beats, paid him for exclusive rights to it. Upon the release of \"IT GIRL\" on September 30, 2023, it went viral on TikTok, soundtracking more than 912,000 videos by November 2023.\n\nThe pop-house song features her rapping about being an \"it girl\", spelling the phrase out in its chorus, over a \"booming\" house beat. For Girls United, Kenyatta Victoria described her energy on the song as \"bubbly yet cocky\", while Moises Mendez II of Time called the song \"bouncy\" and compared her flow on it to that of rappers Azealia Banks and Nicki Minaj.\n\n#ALIYAHCORE #itgirl <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Aliyah%27s+Interlude/_/IT+GIRL\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
