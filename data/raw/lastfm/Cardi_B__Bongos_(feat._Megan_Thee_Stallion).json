It is the pair's second collaboration after their 2020 hit song \"WAP\".\n\nCardi B and Megan Thee Stallion announced \"Bongos\" on September 4, sharing its cover artwork and release date on social media. Cardi B had announced to Vogue México y Latinoamérica in August 2023 that she was not going to release any more collaborations before her next solo single. It was not shared that \"Bongos\" would be included on her upcoming second studio album. Cardi B later explained that the song had been \"part of a plan for a minute now\" and called it \"just one of those records where you need somebody\", revealing that she \"chopped\" up the verses Megan Thee Stallion had sent her, also calling Megan her \"work wife\".\n\nThe music video was released alongside the song on September 8, 2023. It shows Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion at a beach \"wearing over-the-top accessories and custom fits\". Cardi B called the video \"intricate\" and \"beautiful\" and felt it has a \"whole complete different type of theme\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cardi+B/_/Bongos+(feat.+Megan+Thee+Stallion)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
