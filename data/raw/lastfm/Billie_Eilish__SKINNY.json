      "content": "\"SKINNY\" is the opening track of Billie Eilish’s third studio album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. This song serves as a tonal introduction to the themes that run throughout the album, preparing listeners for its emotional depth and contrasting musical styles.\n\nThe track is minimalist in its production, a “palate cleanser” as some reviews describe it, setting the stage for the more intense songs that follow. It’s reflective and introspective, addressing vulnerability and societal pressures, possibly hinting at the way fame and body image affect Billie Eilish’s sense of self.\n\nThe simplicity of “SKINNY” in both its lyrical content and production contrasts with the heavier, more layered tracks later in the album, making it an effective way to ease listeners into the record’s complex emotional landscape. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish/_/SKINNY\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
