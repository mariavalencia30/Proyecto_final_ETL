The song has been critically acclaimed, with many considering it a New York anthem and Pop Smoke's signature song. It earned Pop Smoke a nomination for Best Rap Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nAfter Pop Smoke's tragic death on February 19, 2020, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 and charted in the top 60 of record charts in ten other countries. It also received several certifications, including a triple-platinum certification in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America. It became a prominent anti-police brutality protest anthem in the wake of the George Floyd protests. In November 2020, Pop Smoke's brother Obasi Jackson showed an unreleased version of \"Dior\" on an Instagram live stream, which included unreleased lyrics. The song was included as a bonus track on Pop Smoke's posthumous debut album Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon and the deluxe edition of its follow-up Faith. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pop+Smoke/_/Dior\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
