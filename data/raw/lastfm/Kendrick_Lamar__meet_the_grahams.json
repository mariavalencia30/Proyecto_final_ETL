      "content": "\"Meet The Grahams\" (stylized in all lowercase) is the fourth Drake diss-track from Kendrick Lamar, following 6:16 in LA. As the title implies, Kendrick sends a personal message to each member of the Graham family. It addresses heavy topics like child neglect and abuse, sexual assault allegations, etc. The song was released less than an hour after Drake's response to 6:16 in LA titled \"Family Matters\", in which Drake takes shots at Kendrick for his family relationship, height, and friends such as A$AP Rocky, Metro Boomin, The Weeknd, Rick Ross, etc.\n\nThe album cover is allegedly Drake's belongings, which includes a receipt in his name of him purchasing two different kinds of drugs, Zolpidem and Ozempic. (Zolpidem is a popular drug used for sexual assault all the time since it doesn't stay in your system very long.) The cover also solidifies evidence that Kendrick has insider information about Drake's label, OVO, which he boasts to Drake. However, this cover is only available in the YouTube pre-release version of the song. On streaming services, it is replaced with a blank screen due to rules regarding posting private property.\n\nThe song also claims that Drake, like Adonis once was, has a hidden child—an 11-year-old girl, and potentially a few more. Many speculate this to be true, considering Adonis was kept a secret until Drake got dissed by Pusha T in 2018, in which he admitted he had a child and never dissed Pusha T back. Kendrick also claims that there are sex offenders under OVO who are under payroll by Drake and are not being punished for their wrongdoing. At the song's end, Kendrick no longer recognizes this endless arguing as beef anymore. He says Drake's insecurities are causing him to have a hateful internal battle with himself.\n\nDrake responded with \"THE HEART PT 6\", which he claims that the daughter that Kendrick is alleging exists does not and is false info fed to Kendrick through a false mole. He also says the claim of him being a pedophile which was pushed further on the track Not Like Us was a result of Kendrick having trauma from being sexually assaulted, which is a misinterpretation of the song Mother I Sober, in which Kendrick describes the effect that his mother being sexually assaulted had on him. Drake would pull out of the beef shortly after, deleting all of the instagram posts regarding his diss tracks a month after the track releasing, marking one of the only times that he did pull out. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/meet+the+grahams\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
