Lyrically, Ed sings about meeting someone at a bar and eventually falling in love with her and her body over time.\n\nSheeran had teased the song through a tweet that he had posted on January 5, 2017. The video had a colon that would then merge into a human body, which also can signify the meaning behind the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran/_/Shape+of+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
