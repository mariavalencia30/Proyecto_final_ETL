The previous citizen of Canada to record a chart-topper was Avril Lavigne who reigned with \"Girlfriend\" in May 2007.\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen was destined for success ever since fellow Canadian Justin Bieber began tweeting about a song he had heard on the radio whilst home from Christmas called “Call Me Maybe”. Carly says the song is about “that spark you feel when you lock eyes with someone you like for the first time”, the song debuted at No.1 on the UK singles chart earlier this year.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Carly+Rae+Jepsen/_/Call+Me+Maybe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
