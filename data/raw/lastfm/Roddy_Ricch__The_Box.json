      "content": "Roddy Ricch thinks outside the box on the second track off his debut album, and reflects on retaining his riches while revisiting prior altercations with the law—in August 2019, Roddy was arrested for domestic violence, before being released on bail for $50,000. Roddy has a lengthy history with the law and has been to “the box”—which is slang for jail—numerous times.\n\nAtlantic Records A&R Keefa Black confirmed on Twitter that the unique squeaking sounds that make up the entire track were recorded by Roddy after the song was complete. Producer 30 Roc further recalled how the track came together in an interview with Genius News:\n\nWhen it came down to ‘The Box,’ for me, it was just like, let’s see if we can push him outside of his range. I really didn’t think he was going to do it. […] Then [Roddy] came and he was like, ‘EHH ERR, EHH ERR,’ and we all looked at each other…\n\n“The Box” has seen massive success since its release—it peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The track received a boost in popularity when several videos and memes parodied the production, which helped Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial reach the number one spot on the Billboard 200. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Ricch/_/The+Box\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
