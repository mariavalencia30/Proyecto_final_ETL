      "content": "“Not Like Us” is Kendrick Lamar’s fourth dedicated diss track toward Drake. On the track, Kendrick avenges the West Coast for Drake’s controversial use of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg A.I. voice filters on his song “Taylor Made Freestyle,” Drake’s second diss towards the Compton-born emcee, released on Instagram and removed shortly thereafter because of copyright claims from the estate of the late Tupac Shakur. Kendrick raps over a bouncy Mustard-produced beat which, typical of Mustard’s style, is inspired by hyphy, a genre of Northern Californian hip hop. Kendrick’s zany vocal inflections and fast flows are reminiscent of Bay Area legend E-40, a personal favorite of his.\n\"Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)\nBump that new E-40 after school (Way after school, way after school)\nYou know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)\n— Kendrick Lamar, “Money Trees”\nThe song was released on the evening of May 4, 2024, not even twenty-four hours after the release of “meet the grahams,” Kendrick’s third dedicated diss towards Drake.\nAmongst other disses, notably calling Drake a snitch and culture vulture, Kendrick doubles down — and progresses — on prior-made allegations of sexual deviancy. This time, he outright calls Drake a “pedophile.”\nThe YouTube thumbnail features a Google Maps screenshot of Drake’s mansion at Park Lane Circle in Toronto, Canada. Park Lane Circle is “a Toronto oasis where celebrities love to build extremely lavish mansions.” The thumbnail, edited in a way that closely resembles the modern sex offender registry, which pinpoints the residency of a convicted offender, is continuing the thread of allegations by Kendrick Lamar that Drake is a sexual predator, It insinuates that Drake’s mansion, nicknamed “The Embassy,” is a hub for illegal activities, particularly pedophilia and/or sex trafficking.\nThe track was first teased on Twitter by two persons: one of Kendrick’s associates and Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith, the founder of TDE, the label and collective that Kendrick belonged to before retiring to his pgLang enterprise. The first tweet stated that “he’s nowhere near done.” Top Dawg posted,“Dot, I see dead people 💀” hinting at the opening line of the song, which dropped approximately two hours later. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Not+Like+Us\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
