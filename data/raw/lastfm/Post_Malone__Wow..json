      "content": "“Wow.” is Post Malone’s first single for his third studio album Hollywood’s Bleeding and is also Post’s first release since his October 2018 collaboration with Swae Lee, “Sunflower.”\n\nThe song is thematically similar to “Congratulations,” a massive hit from his 2016 debut album Stoney which is even referenced in the second verse. Both songs focus on Post showing off his wealth, such as cars and money, to the people who doubted him before he was famous.\n\nThe cover art for Post’s collaboration with Young Thug, “Goodbyes,” has text that reads “Single 02,” suggesting “Wow.” is the first single from his third album. When “Wow.” was released, Post made significant changes to his social media accounts, most notably changing the color theme from yellow to blue. This change is likely representative of the color of his next album, which makes sense considering he shared thoughts of trying to release a new album back in November of 2018:\n\n\"Trying to put out a new body of work before the end of the year but we all know how that goes wish me luck…\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Post+Malone/_/Wow.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
