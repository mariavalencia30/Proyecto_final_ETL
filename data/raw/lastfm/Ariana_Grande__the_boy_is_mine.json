      "content": "\"the boy is mine\" is the third single from Ariana Grande's seventh studio album, eternal sunshine.\n\nThe track functions as an indirect sequel to her leaked, unreleased song fantasize, which went viral on platforms such as TikTok in 2023. Since then, many fans have clamored for a real 90s-inspired R&B/Pop record from her.\n\nIn an interview on Apple Music with Zane Lowe, Grande detailed how  the boy is mine and  true story work as sister tracks, where the former is the \"bad girl anthem\" that the latter sets up. On the provocative nature of the song and amid accusations of being a \"home-wrecker,\" she said: \"This is a very bad idea, I think, but… There is a large group of my fans that really do love a bad girl anthem. And this is kind of an elevated version of that.\"\n\nThe music video was released on June 7, 2024. In the video, Grande reprises her role as Peaches, a Catwoman-inspired figure, while Penn Badgley stars as the city’s mayor dealing with a rat infestation by releasing feral cats. In addition, Brandy and Monica, who appear on the official remix released June 21, appeared as news anchors in the video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/_/the+boy+is+mine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
