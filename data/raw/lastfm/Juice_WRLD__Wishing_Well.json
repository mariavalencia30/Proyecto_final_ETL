What began as recreational drug use morphed into an addiction that ultimately led to his early death at the tender age of 21. Juice seemingly predicted his own demise on his June 2018 tribute to XXXTENTACION and Lil Peep, who also died young:\n\n\"What’s the 27 Club? We ain’t making it past 21\"\n\nOn December 8, 2019, Juice WRLD suffered an accidental overdose at Midway International Airport in Chicago. He reportedly swallowed multiple pills after law enforcement attempted to intercept his crew upon suspicion of gun and drug possession. The Cook County Medical Examiner confirmed that fatal levels of codeine and oxycodone were present in his body—the latter of which is found in Percocet, or “Perky,” as it is called in the song’s chorus.\n\nBefore its official release, the song was previewed in March 2018 on Instagram Live. It was then leaked on October 6, 2019, with an extended verse. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+WRLD/_/Wishing+Well\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
