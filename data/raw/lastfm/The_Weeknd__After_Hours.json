The song addresses a failed relationship that ended in heartbreak and serves as an apology letter for his past transgressions, as he desires reconciliation.\n\nAdditionally, the song’s dark vibes and altered vocals over hard-hitting production are reminiscent of styles seen on Abel’s earlier music such as November 2012’s Trilogy. The track is also thematically similar to songs from that era, as he once again details the pain and anguish associated with heartbreak.\n\nOn February 18, 2020, the day before the track’s release, Abel revealed the album’s cover art and teased the track’s release date via social media. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd/_/After+Hours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
