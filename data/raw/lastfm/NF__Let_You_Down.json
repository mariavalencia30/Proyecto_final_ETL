      "content": "\"Let You Down\" is a song performed by American rapper and songwriter NF. It serves as the third single from his third studio album \"Perception\"  and was released on September 14, 2017, for digital download and streaming, including an audio video.\n\nThe song is NF's highest-charting song to date, peaking at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Pop Songs chart. As well as reaching mainstream charts internationally, \"Let You Down\" charted on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs and Hot Rhythmic Songs, reaching the No. 1 spot on the former chart. It is his first song to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It was later certified 3× Platinum in the US and also reached multi-Platinum in several other countries, including Canada and Australia.\n\nOn “Let You Down,” NF laments the struggles he had earlier in his life, and looking back at himself he felt like he “let himself down.” This track is similar to his songs “Got You On My Mind” and “Wish You Wouldn’t,” from his previous album Therapy Session.\n\nJust like “Outro” and “Green Lights,” NF tweeted the first letter of the track—in this case, “L,” which could have been alluding either to “Let You Down” or “Lie.” Nine minutes later, he tweeted out the letter “E,” largely supporting the thought of it being “Let You Down.” The track was later officially confirmed to be “Let You Down” through a separate tweet. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/NF/_/Let+You+Down\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
