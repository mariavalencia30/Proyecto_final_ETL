      "content": "“Set Fire to the Rain” is a song by British singer-songwriter Adele, released in November 2011 as the third single from her second studio album, 21 (2011). Written by Adele and Fraser T. Smith, who also produced the track, the song became one of Adele’s most commercially successful singles and solidified her reputation as a powerhouse vocalist and songwriter.\n\nBackground\nAdele co-wrote “Set Fire to the Rain” during the sessions for 21, an album inspired by her personal experiences with heartbreak and self-discovery. Unlike the album’s more stripped-down tracks, this song features lush production and a dramatic, sweeping arrangement.\n\nAdele has described the song as being about the contradictions of a broken relationship—moments of vulnerability alongside empowerment—capturing emotional turmoil and resilience.\n\nMusical style\n“Set Fire to the Rain” is a mid-tempo pop-soul ballad with strong influences from blues and contemporary pop. The song features prominent piano, swelling strings, and powerful drum fills, creating a cinematic soundscape that supports Adele’s commanding vocal performance.\n\nIts grandiose style stands out on 21, offering a richer, more orchestral feel compared to the album’s typically minimalist production.\n\nLyrical analysis\nThe lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, betrayal, and emotional catharsis. The chorus—“But I set fire to the rain / Watched it pour as I touched your face”—uses vivid imagery to depict the complex feelings of loving someone who ultimately causes pain.\n\nThe song reflects Adele’s signature ability to balance vulnerability with strength, making it relatable to listeners navigating love and loss.\n\nChart performance\nIn the United States, “Set Fire to the Rain” reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Adele’s third consecutive chart-topper from 21.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song was not released as a single but still gained significant radio play and charted within the top 15 based on digital sales.\n\nIt also topped charts in several other countries, including Belgium, Poland, and the Netherlands, and achieved multi-platinum status globally.\n\nMusic video\nInstead of a traditional music video, a live performance of “Set Fire to the Rain” from Adele’s Live at the Royal Albert Hall concert film was released to promote the single. The performance highlighted Adele’s live vocal prowess and was widely praised for its raw emotional delivery.\n\nAwards and accolades\nThe song contributed to Adele’s Grammy wins in 2012, where 21 swept major categories.\n\nIt has appeared in numerous “Best of the Decade” lists and is often cited as one of Adele’s definitive ballads.\n\nLive performances\n“Set Fire to the Rain” has been a staple of Adele’s concert setlists. Its dramatic build-up and soaring vocals make it a centerpiece of her live shows, often met with rapturous applause and standing ovations.\n\nPersonnel\nAdele – vocals, co-writer\n\nFraser T. Smith – co-writer, producer, instruments\n\nChris Dave – drums\n\nReception\nCritics praised “Set Fire to the Rain” for its powerful vocal performance and evocative production. Many noted the song’s emotional intensity and its ability to balance polished pop production with deep personal storytelling.\n\nThe song remains one of Adele’s most streamed and downloaded singles, continuing to resonate with listeners around the world.\n\nTrivia\n“Set Fire to the Rain” was Adele’s third No. 1 hit in the U.S., following “Rolling in the Deep” and “Someone Like You.”\n\nAlthough a concept music video was planned, it was ultimately scrapped, making the live performance the song’s official visual.\n\nThe track has been covered and remixed by numerous artists across genres, further demonstrating its wide-reaching impact. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Set+Fire+to+the+Rain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
