      "content": "”Unholy” is a song by English singer Sam Smith and a collaboration with German-born singer and songwriter, Kim Petras.\n\nThe song is unlike anything Smith has done before and signals their determination to extend their range; to experiment. In an interview with Billboard magazine in August 2022 Sam talked about their need to move away from sad ballads and explore new directions.\n\n”Gone are the heartbroken torch songs that defined so much of their [Sam’s] early career; in their place are jubilant sounds ranging from dance-pop kiss-offs to choral expressions of elation. And for Smith, leaning into happiness may be the greatest risk of all… “I think joy for me, and for a lot of queer people, is quite a dangerous place. We’re all masters of pain, and I think it’s … courageous to step into the queer joy of it all.”’\n\nThe song tells a story of unfaithfulness and betrayal, reminiscent of “I’m Not The Only One”. The response isn’t grief and passivity, but resilience, humour and mischief; not to be taken seriously and therefore a definite new departure.\n\nThe track became one of Smith's most successful hits internationally, topping Billboard's Global 200 and singles charts including The UK, Australia, and Malaysia. In the United States, \"Unholy\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 on the week of October 29, 2022, becoming both Smith & Petras' first #1 in the country and making them the first openly transgender artists in history to top the chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Smith/_/Unholy+(feat.+Kim+Petras)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
