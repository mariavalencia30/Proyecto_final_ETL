The song was released to US pop radio as the second single from his third studio album, Harry's House, on 21 June 2022. A music video for the song was later released on 13 July 2022, in which Styles is shown exploring the world on different beds.\n\n\"Late Night Talking\" was described as a \"glossy R&B shifter\" that fills \"every available space with some or other moving part, right down to vocal parts mimicking brass\".\n\nThe video, directed by Bradley and Pablo and released on 13 July 2022, finds Styles following a portal in his own bed that leads him to an array of other beds — one in an art gallery, another in a restaurant, a theatre, and another that speeds through the streets of London past Buckingham Palace. The clip also comes complete with a pillow fight and Styles officiating a bed-ridden wedding, before falling through the sky on his bed.\n\nHe performed a live version of the song on the Today Show on May 19, and also included the song in a set he performed for BBC Radio 1, along with \"As It Was\", \"Boyfriends\" and a cover of \"Wet Dream\" by Wet Leg on 24 May 2022. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/_/Late+Night+Talking\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
