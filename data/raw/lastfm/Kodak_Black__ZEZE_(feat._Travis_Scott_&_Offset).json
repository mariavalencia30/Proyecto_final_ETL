      "content": "Kodak Black enlists Offset and Travis Scott for “ZEZE,” a song on which the trio discusses their decadent lifestyles on the song. Produced by Chicago-native d.a. got that dope, this track heavily features steel drum instrumentation.\n\nFollowing “If I’m Lyin, I’m Flyin” two weeks prior, this is Kodak’s second single since being released from jail in August 2018 and the second single from Dying to Live.\n\nIn early September 2018, Kodak posted a now-deleted short clip of him and Travis Scott dancing to the song’s instrumental in the studio. This video became a viral sensation known as the #WaitingChallenge that inspired numerous memes. Kodak later posted another video of just himself dancing to the instrumental.\n\nKodak performed during the Florida A&M University homecoming festivities on October 5, 2018, and announced the song’s name and release date. One day before the song’s release, Kodak posted the cover art, which revealed that Offset was on the song, which was previously unknown. The song was released as expected on October 12, 2018.\n\nThe official music video was released on November 23, 2018. Travis Scott directed the video by himself. The video depicts the three rappers having a problem with the original film director, and hence things are the way they are. It is basically a behind-the-scenes twisted video, showing the three under a green screen and editing their effects. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kodak+Black/_/ZEZE+(feat.+Travis+Scott+&+Offset)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
