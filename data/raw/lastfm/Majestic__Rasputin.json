It has charted in the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Poland and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"After constantly coming across the Boney M classic ‘Rasputin’ on TikTok I thought to myself that due to its incredible disco roots and instrumentation it could lend itself to become an amazing piece of modern dance music! Some of favourite house records of all time are those that have used samples of classic disco records …. think Armand Van Helden – You don’t even know me (sampling the Carrie Lucas 1979 classic Dance with you) or Stardust’s – Music Sounds Better (sampling the legendary Chaka Khan – Fate).\n\nFor me I felt there was something in the original that would lend itself perfectly to a modern day twist and that coupled with the viral nature of the original it felt like a perfect melting pot! Now I am sat with a record with Boney M… who let’s face it are truly iconic.\"\n\n- via Radio and Music <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Majestic/_/Rasputin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
