Throughout the track, Travis makes several notations of the lack of love he feels while contrasting the topics as he boasts his success and affluence.\n\nIn the first part of the track, assisted by the melancholy and gloomy vocals provided by Sampha, Travis particularly touches on the lack of love in his life despite it being filled with materialistic values which tend to make people happy.\n\nHowever, in the second part of the track, Travis flips the warm, somber rhythm to a faster trap cadence in which it could be perceived that he’s bragging, however, behind that, Travis speaks about his personal view of life, particularly noting that he desires his childhood more than ever.\n\nSurprisingly, Travis references the ASTROWORLD Festival crowd crush in the lines, \"I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me. If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/MY+EYES\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
