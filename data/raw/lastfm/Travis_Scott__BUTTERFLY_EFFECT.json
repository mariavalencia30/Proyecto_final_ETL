Scott is also using a double-entendre with “butterfly” wherein, as he refers to the doors on his Lamborghini car; he also describes moving to his new life, how great it is, and how he could never go back to the old one.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, Travis released the track on SoundCloud, along with two other songs: “A Man” and “Green & Purple (feat. Playboi Carti).” However, “BUTTERFLY EFFECT” was the only one out of the three songs that was released as a proper single onto streaming services.
