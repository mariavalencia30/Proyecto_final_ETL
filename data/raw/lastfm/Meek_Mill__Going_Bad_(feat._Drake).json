He most notably accused Drake of not writing his own raps, specifically his verse on “R.I.C.O.” Drake subtly responded to Meek’s accusations on “Charged Up” before unleashing his vicious diss track, “Back to Back.” Following these songs, the two would go on to take numerous shots at each other on wax.\n\nMeek and Drake officially squashed their beef on September 8, 2018, when Drake brought Meek on stage during the Boston show of the Aubrey & The Three Migos Tour. However, in an interview with BigBoyTV, Meek revealed that he and Drake had been in contact for about a year before their public reconciliation.\n\nThe song’s mafia-inspired music video was released on February 7, 2019. It was directed by Kid Art and features cameo appearances from a plethora of artists and other celebrities. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Meek+Mill/_/Going+Bad+(feat.+Drake)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
