      "content": "\"Is It Over Now?\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It is a previously unreleased \"From the Vault\" track from her fourth re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor's Version)  (2023). Republic Records released \"Is It Over Now?\" to US contemporary hit radio stations on October 31, 2023.\n\nWritten and produced by Swift and Jack Antonoff, \"Is It Over Now?\" is an electropop song built around energetic drums, retro synthesizers, sparse production elements and an idiosyncratic vocal sample. Rooted in storytelling, it chronicles a complex but misbegotten romance riddled with uncertainty and resentment using lyrical devices such as couplets, internal rhymes and rhetorical questions.\n\nUpon the album's release, \"Is It Over Now?\" received acclaim from music critics, many of whom highlighted it as a standout track, emphasizing its engaging composition, blunt lyrical approach, and vocal cadence, whereas some considered it one of Swift's finest works, exemplary of her songcraft. A few reviews compared \"Is It Over Now?\" with Swift's 2016 single \"Out of the Woods\". In the United States, the song replaced Swift's own \"Cruel Summer\" atop the Billboard Hot 100, marking her 11th number-one song and making her the first soloist to dethrone herself on the chart twice. Elsewhere, \"Is It Over Now?\" charted at number one in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as well. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Is+It+Over+Now%3F+(Taylor%27s+Version)+(From+the+Vault)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
