He shows that love can be given in many ways and that all deserve a chance for love.\n\n\"We created the beat from scratch, me and Joel Little. I just wanted something not necessarily positive, but super upbeat. Hearing the chords, “I was like this sounds anthemic.“ And I was like, “You know what. I’m young, I’m dumb, and I’m broke. I’ve been young, I’ve been dumb, and I’ve been broke.” That’s pretty much where the basis of the song came from. I feel like the whole project is all about me being honest. And I felt like, you can’t get more honest than calling yourself young, dumb, and broke.\"\n\n“Young Dumb & Broke” was certified 9x platinum by the RIAA on March 3, 2022. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Khalid/_/Young+Dumb+&+Broke\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
