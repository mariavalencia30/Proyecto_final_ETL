I was like, ‘Oh what is this?’ and that led me to watching the movie. I thought it would be very romantic and sweet, but it turned out that it’s actually a very realistic and stark depiction of a breakup. So when we were talking about the main track, this movie suddenly came to my mind, and I thought it would fit well with the kind of song we wanted to make. So I watched the film again, and I included different points of inspiration into the song. There are some interesting excerpts of dialogue at the beginning and at the end of the track that express exactly what I wanted to say.“\n\n– Jimin via Rolling Stone\n Like Crazy <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jimin/_/Like+Crazy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
