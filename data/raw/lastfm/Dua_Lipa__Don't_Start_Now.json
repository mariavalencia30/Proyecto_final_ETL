      "content": "\"Don't Start Now\" is a song recorded by Dua Lipa and serves as the lead single from her sophomore album, 'Future Nostalgia'. Released on October 31st, 2019,\n\nDua began teasing the new era on Oct 1st, 2019, when she posted to Instagram a photo of her revealing her new hairstyle. Eventually, on 11 October, via an interview Dua's management did with Variety, the official release date was announced as 31 October 2019. Dua then blacked out the majority of her social media accounts, such as Instagram and Twitter, to signify the beginning of the era. The song was announced officially by Dua herself on 22 October 2019.\n\nMusically is a nu-disco song, it features elements of dance-pop, Eurodance , and synth-pop while channeling modern disco antecedents such as French house and Italo disco, additionally has a percolating funk bassline that interchanges with piano chords and the house beat. According to Lipa, the lyrics have a theme of empowerment and are about \"moving on\" from a past relationship and \"not allowing anyone to get in the way of that\", while also finding confidence and happiness.\n\nThe song was a great global success, especially in Europe, Australia, and North America. It has over 9 billion streams collectively, on YouTube, its music video has over 750 million views and on Spotify it has more than 3 billion streams, being the 2nd female solo song to achieve the mark. It has been a radio, streaming, and chart force since then. \"Don't Start Now\" has also been a great success critically, and has enhanced Dua's career to new heights, considered to be the beginning of a revival for disco music in 2020s.\n\nIt was written by Lipa, Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren, and Ian Kirkpatrick, with the latter as the producer. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/_/Don%27t+Start+Now\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
