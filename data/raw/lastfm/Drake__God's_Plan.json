Anyone who tries to work their way into his life must have an ulterior motive to benefit themselves.\n\nThe official music video shared a different sentiment though, as Drake took the budget for the video, a whopping $996,631.90 and gave it away to families, schools, charities, and more. It was directed by Karena Evans, who also hails from Toronto, and is a protege of Director X.\nDirector X has had a hand in a number of Drake music videos in the past, including “Hotline Bling” and “Started From The Bottom.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/God%27s+Plan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
