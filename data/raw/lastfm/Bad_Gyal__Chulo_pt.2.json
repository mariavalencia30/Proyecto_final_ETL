Both Tokischa and Young Miko have been able to give another approach to the song, transforming it into a perfect continuation of the original and moving it away from a typical remix.” In addition, Young miko has said: “It's the first song I've done a remix on, and if I'm honest I'm not into remixes. With 'Chulo' it was a necessity, I loved it too much and I felt like I had to be there if that remix was given. In Las Vegas I was more with Bad Gyal and that day she showed me the new version with Tokischa. I wanted to, but I wasn't going to tell him anything. It was she who came forward. I was very excited and that same night I wrote my verse” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Gyal/_/Chulo+PT.2\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
