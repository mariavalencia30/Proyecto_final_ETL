This song placed Anthony on the map, so much that legendary country star John Rich offered his assistance to help produce a record.\n\nFollowing the song's usage at the 2023 Republican National Debate, Anthony stated that the song was  misinterpreted by the candidates who discussed it, saying “It was funny seeing my song at the presidential debate, because I wrote that song about those people, you know. So for them to have to sit there and listen to that, that cracks me up. It was funny seeing the response to it. That song has nothing to do with Joe Biden — it’s a lot bigger than Joe Biden. That song is written about the people on that stage — and a lot more, too. Not just them, but definitely them.”. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oliver+Anthony+Music/_/Rich+Men+North+of+Richmond\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
