      "content": "“Rush” is the lead single from Troye Sivan's third studio album 'Something To Give Each Other', which got released on October 13th.\nThe track was released through EMI and Capitol on July 13th, 2023 along with an accompanying music video. The song marks Sivan’s first solo release in over five years.\n\nThe track was first teased on Instagram in early June, with a snippet of the song playing over the song’s credits. The snippet was then uploaded to TikTok in a series of videos hinting towards Sivan’s crush on Hyunjin from Stray Kids. A few weeks later, Sivan posted multiple dance videos showcasing the song’s choreography, which was later featured in the music video. The sexy, queer-celebrating music video was directed by Gordon von Steiner and features choreography from Sergio Reis.\n\n“Rush” was crafted by Alex Chapman, NOVODOR, and Kevin Hickey- featuring additional production from Styalz Fuego, and writing from Troye Sivan. The title of the song was inspired by a poppers brand of the same name, and lyrically describes dancing with “someone hot”. Sonically, the track is a club-pop song with electronic and house influences.\n\nThe song was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 in four countries: Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ireland. In the singer’s home country, the song peaked at #12 and at #1 on the Australian dance charts. In the US, the track reached #77 and #3 on the electronic dance club songs chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Troye+Sivan/_/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
