As someone who’s been writing songs since I was 9, who studied music since I was 12, and who dreamed of being a performer, Max Martin is the dream collaborator. Recording it was like watching a legend in action. He’s an extremely collaborative, open, creative soul. The song is a callback to when pop records had key changes—that golden era of late-‘80s and early-'90s pop when singers had massive records that were vocally impressive but also danceable, and the production quality was very intentional. I think it’s a work of art. It’s a masterpiece.\"\n\n—via Apple Music <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lizzo/_/2+Be+Loved+(Am+I+Ready)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
