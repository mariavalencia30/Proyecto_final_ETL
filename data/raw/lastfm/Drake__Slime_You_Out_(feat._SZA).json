      "content": "\"Slime You Out\" is a song by Canadian rapper and singer Drake featuring American singer-songwriter SZA. It was released through OVO Sound and Republic Records as the lead single from Drake's eighth studio album, For All the Dogs, on September 15, 2023. The song was produced by Drake himself, 40, Bnyx, Noel Cadastre, and Dalton Tennant, and the five wrote it alongside SZA, Chris Powell, and Grant Lapointe, due to the song sampling \"Just Ask Me\" by the Soul Superbs. \"Slime You Out\" is an R&B song.\n\nBoth artists were first linked together in the lyrics of \"Mr. Right Now\" when Drake revealed that he had dated her back in 2008. SZA initially responded by unfollowing the rapper on Instagram. However, she later confirmed that they dated back in 2009 and that it was \"all love all peace\". In December 2022, she once again confirmed that they had always been \"cool\" with each other.\n\nOn September 14, 2023, Drake and SZA shared a single cover of Halle Berry covered in slime at the 2012 Kids' Choice Awards on their social media, alluding to a collaboration. However, the posts contained no further information besides the artists tagging each other. Berry voiced out her disappointment in Drake on Instagram, stating that when the rapper's team asked her to give him permission to use her picture as a single cover, she refused. The single was eventually announced on September 15. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Slime+You+Out+(feat.+SZA)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
