The cause of his death is unknown, but it could be a major factor of what Justin croons about on the song.\n\n\"There’s this weird dichotomy that it is really sad but with an uplifting beat. It’s about losing someone you love. It even works in this quarantine situation we’re in, in that we’re not socialising, relating and connecting in the same way. The memory of you can be taken in different ways.\" - Justin Bieber via Official Charts\n\nOn March 31, 2021, the song debuted at #66 on the Billboard Hot 100, and a year later, on April 2nd, 2022, the song peaked at #5. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Bieber/_/Ghost\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
