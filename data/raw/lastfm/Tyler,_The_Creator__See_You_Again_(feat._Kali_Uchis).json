The song features vocals from Kali Uchis, who appeared on Tyler’s 2015 album Cherry Bomb on “FIND YOUR WINGS” and “FUCKING YOUNG / PERFECT.”\n\nThe person Tyler sings to on this song seems to be his ideal lover, as they only live in his fantasy and dream state. Whenever he wakes up this person disappears, and therefore he doesn’t wish to wake up. While he is very much in love with them, he hates constantly waiting and chasing.\n\nThe song directly follows the interlude “Sometimes...” where we hear a male voice ask Shane Powers to play the song about him on Golf Radio. What comes next is “See You Again.” This implies that the song is likely about a man.\n\nTyler brought up the song two times during a self-published interview titled FLOWER BOY: a conversation that he released on his YouTube channel.\n\n“See You Again” was certified platinum by the RIAA on August 5, 2019. It was Tyler’s first platinum certification of any track in his discography.\n\nThe track was later certified 2x platinum on March 23, 2021. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tyler,+The+Creator/_/See+You+Again+(feat.+Kali+Uchis)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
