      "content": "“Uptown Funk” is the fourth track on and first single off of Mark Ronson’s fourth studio album, Uptown Special. The song features American singer and songwriter Bruno Mars It topped the Billboard charts and has sold over 6,000,000 copies in the United States alone.\n\n“When we hit on that opening line — ‘This hit, that ice cold/ Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold’ – we knew that we had the seed of this really exciting idea. I pushed myself much more than I have on anything else in the past.“\n\n—Mark Ronson\n\nThe songwriting credits on this song were revised to include The Gap Band after people noted similarities between this song and their hit “Oops Upside My Head.”\n\nAmerican bands Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings and Antibalas perform horn parts on the song, while the song's lyrics interpolate a line from rapper Trinidad James' song \"All Gold Everything\" (2012). Several music critics noted its similarity with popular music from the 1980s. The song features heavy inspiration from the Minneapolis sound of 1980s-era funk music, having a spirit akin to works by Prince as well as Morris Day and The Time.\n\n“Uptown Funk” won the 58th Annual Grammy Award for Record of the Year & Best Pop/Duo Group Performance. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Ronson/_/Uptown+Funk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
