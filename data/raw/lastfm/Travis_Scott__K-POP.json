      "content": "“K-POP,” the  Bad Bunny and The Weeknd-accompanied song is the lead single to Travis Scott’s fourth full-length studio album, UTOPIA. The bouncy trap song sees an expected addition of pop alongside Latin dancehall to provide an exhilarating feeling besides the warm beat, allowing the artists to smoothly flow on the beat.\n\nThe song’s world-class production from Boi-1da and MIKE DEAN—alongside several other up-and-coming producers—feature an obvious use of snares and melodies to back the artist’s soothing and warm undertone, giving a mellow psychedelic feeling to the track, revealing a similar cadence to Drake and Travis', “Fair Trade.”\n\nThe single was first previewed at an event in Monaco in which Travis was previewing music from UTOPIA. The track was officially announced by Travis himself on July 19, 2023, through his official Instagram. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/K-POP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
