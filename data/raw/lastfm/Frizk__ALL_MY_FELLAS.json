This track was not sampled in ALL MY FELLAS as Frizk stated in his YouTube video \"How I made ALL MY FELLAS\", even though they sound extremely similar. This video features Frizk talking to his audience and explaining what he did to make this track. ALL MY FELLAS reached #3 on most Shazamed tracks for the dance genre in October 2023. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frizk/_/ALL+MY+FELLAS\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
