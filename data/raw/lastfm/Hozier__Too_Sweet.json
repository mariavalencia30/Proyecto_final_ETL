      "content": "“Too Sweet“ is a song by Irish singer-songwriter Hozier. It was released on 22 March 2024, through Rubyworks and Island Records in the UK, and Columbia Records in the US, as the first track from his fifth EP Unheard and was released as a single on 29 March 2024. The song has topped the charts in Australia, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States, becoming Hozier's first number-one single in all seven countries.\n\nOn 14 March 2024, Hozier announced his fifth EP Unheard that features four previously unreleased tracks taken from sessions for his third studio album Unreal Unearth. The singer clarified that the songs \"could not make the original release\" for various reasons, but still fit the themes of \"gluttony, limbo, violence and the outward 'ascent'\". He first teased the song the same day on TikTok in a clip that features him drawing a sketch of a skeleton. \"Too Sweet\" was surprise-released as the opening track to the project on 22 March.\n\n\"Too Sweet\" debuted at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart on 29 March 2024, earning Hozier his first top-ten single in the United Kingdom since \"Take Me to Church\" in 2014 and second overall. It rose to number 4 on 5 April 2024. On 12 April 2024, it reached Number 1 with 61,000 chart units and 6.7 million streams, becoming Hozier's first UK number one single.\n\nIn the United States, \"Too Sweet\" debuted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of 6 April 2024, marking Hozier's first top 10 debut and second top 10 after \"Take Me to Church\". Three weeks later, the song reached number one, surpassing the number two peak of \"Take Me to Church\" and becoming Hozier's first number-one in the United States. With this, Hozier became the first Irish act to top the Billboard Hot 100 since Sinéad O'Connor in 1990 with \"Nothing Compares 2 U\", and fourth overall along with O'Connor, Gilbert O'Sullivan and U2. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Hozier/_/Too+Sweet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
