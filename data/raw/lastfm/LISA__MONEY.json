      "content": "MONEY is a song by Thai rapper and singer LISA from her debut single album LALISA (2021). It was released to US contemporary hit radio by Interscope Records on November 9, 2021, as the second single from the album. The lyrics for the track were written by Bekuh Boom and Vince, with music being composed by them alongside 24 and R.Tee. It is an American rap style track over a laid-back horn beat with boastful lyrics about spending money and being rich. The song marked LISA’s final release as a soloist under YG and Interscope, before her departure from the labels in December 2023. \n\nMONEY achieved commercial success worldwide and peaked at number ten on the Billboard Global 200, becoming LISA’s second top-ten hit and the longest-charting song at the time by a K-pop soloist. The track figured within the record charts of 26 countries, and became the longest-charting song at the time by a K-pop female soloist on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart among others. It received mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented LISA’s rap skills and confidence.\n\nAn exclusive performance video for MONEY was directed by Lee Sang-yoon and uploaded to BLACKPINK’s YouTube channel on September 24, 2021. It surpassed one billion views in 2024, making LISA the second female K-pop soloist and third overall to achieve the feat. The song has since been certified diamond in Brazil and gold in France, Poland, Portugal and Spain, and earned a Guinness World Record in 2023 for being the first K-pop track by a solo artist to reach one billion streams on Spotify. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa/_/MONEY\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
