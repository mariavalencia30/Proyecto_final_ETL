      "content": "On the melancholy and soft sound of Metro Boomin’s “Creepin,” The Weeknd and 21 Savage talk about the vulnerability of all the lies and “keep it in secret” moments that got the cheating of their relationships — 21 also talks about the expensive things he does before to conquer fake love.\n\nHints of the song surfaced one week before the album’s reveal, where a now-deleted Instagram post, shows The Weeknd along with Metro Boomin joining again, hinting at the participation of the singer — It would not be until December 1, when Metro Boomin would reveal the singer’s participation during an Instagram Story, through a personalized photo of the album’s cover art but with Weeknd in it.\n\nMetro would confirm it in more detail during the album’s rollout with an Instagram post showing the singer’s involvement as a comic character, where Weeknd would make a comment referring to the song:\n\n\"Creeeeeepin'\"\n\nThe song shows tribute to Mario Winans’s R&B classic 2004 song, “I Don’t Wanna Know”, interpolating both The Weeknd’s verses and chorus, along with the sample of the song here.\n\n“Creepin'” heavily samples Mario Winan’s “I Don’t Wanna Know”, which in turn is based off the same sample the Fugees used, Enya’s 1987 instrumental “Boadicea”. Winans is a credited co-writer on the Weeknd’s 2020 song “After Hours”, having “messed around with some chord structures and changed stuff for the bridge”. In a sense, “Creepin'” might be the Weeknd’s way of returning the favour.\n\n“Creepin'” debuted at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the chart week ending of December 17, 2022.\n\nOn February 27, 2023, “Creepin'” was certified platinum by the RIAA. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metro+Boomin/_/Creepin%27+(with+The+Weeknd+&+21+Savage)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
