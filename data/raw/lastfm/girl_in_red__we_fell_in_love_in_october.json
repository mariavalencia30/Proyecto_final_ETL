The song is about how they fell in love during fall and Marie’s (girl in red’s) feelings toward her.\n\nIn an interview with The Fader, Marie states that there was a lot of drama between the two and that she struggled accepting her. After a while when everything began to settle in, she accepted her and created this song as a tribute.\n\nThis song is a prequel to girl in red’s “forget her”, which is about the two breaking up. “we fell in love in october” is girl in red’s most popular song on Spotify to date.\n\n\"I wrote in 2015, and it’s basically the first song I wrote about a girl in the first relationship I had with a girl. I had broken up with my boyfriend and I’d been in this relationship with this girl and it’s just me declaring my love for this girl. Just screaming, “My girl, my girl!” twenty times in the chorus and sort of just owning it because I struggled a long time accepting it, and there was so much shit going on with this girl, there was just so much drama. It’s about when things have kind of settled and I’m like Fuck yeah, this is my girl. And you will be my girl. I don’t know, I love this girl.\"\n\n—girl in red, The Fader <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/girl+in+red/_/we+fell+in+love+in+october\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
