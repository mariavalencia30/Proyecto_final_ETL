The video featured Juice at an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting, an organization whose goal is to “stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety.” The AA setting is also similar to Eminem’s “When I’m Gone” music video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+WRLD/_/Lean+Wit+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
