Sam and Normani, by coincidence, were working at the same time in a Los Angeles studio with producer StarGate. In an interview to Zane Lowe, Sam said:\n\nI was with StarGate […]when she [Normani] came in that day [ …]. I said to her ‘Do you want to hear the song?’ […]. She’s special […] she just jumped on the song there with me and she sang it and it was perfect.\n\nThe collaboration was timely for Sam, who had been a fan of Fifth Harmony, the girl group Normani gained recognition and fame with, and especially a fan of hers since seeing her performance with Khalid of ‘Love Lies’ for Billboard. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Smith/_/Dancing+with+a+Stranger+(with+Normani)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
