      "content": "\"I Like Me Better\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Lauv. It was released on May 19, 2017, and is included on Lauv's compilation album \"I Met You When I Was 18 (The Playlist)\", which was released on May 31, 2018. It has also been used in an Android Auto app commercial, in the trailer of Netflix's romantic comedy \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before,\" and in the fall ball episode of Netflix's comedy series \"The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia\".\n\n\"I Like Me Better\" reached the top ten in Australia, Austria and Germany, the top-twenty in New Zealand and Slovakia, and the top-forty in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland. In his native United States, the song was a sleeper hit, spending over six months on the US Billboard Hot 100 before reaching number 27 in September 2018. It was used in the Miss Universe 2018 Evening Gown Competition as its background music.\n\nThe song was inspired by Lauv's move to New York City and falling in love shortly afterwards. After arriving at the studio with \"no concept, no lyrics, no idea I was going to write that song\" he chopped together a voice memo he left himself intending to change the sound later although he never did.\n\nMusically, \"I Like Me Better\" is an electropop song that contains elements of Guitar pop, snap and Alt-pop, as well as vocal effects. According to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com, the song is written in the key of A major. The song's verses are resigned and have a quaint and simple sound, laden with a simple, jangly guitar loop, an Electric piano and a sparse, finger-click beat that transitions into drum beats in the chorus. Lauv's vocals span from the low note of B2 to the high note of C#5. It features a prominent sound effect that sounds similar to a synthesizer. The sound was Lauv's voice, which he recorded on his phone. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lauv/_/I+Like+Me+Better\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
