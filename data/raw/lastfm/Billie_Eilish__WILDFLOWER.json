      "content": "“WILDFLOWER” from Billie Eilish’s third studio album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT is a deeply introspective track about navigating the emotional complexities of relationships, especially the lingering effects of a partner’s past. The song explores feelings of insecurity and the challenge of moving forward while still haunted by memories of a partner’s ex. In the lyrics, Billie reflects on the emotional weight of a previous relationship and wonders how much of it still lingers in her partner’s heart.\n\nKey themes include heartbreak, jealousy, and vulnerability, as Billie questions whether she has crossed emotional lines and if her partner is also grappling with memories of their ex. The imagery in the song, such as “burning like a fever” and “crying on Valentine’s Day in a hotel,” evokes a sense of both physical and emotional intensity, highlighting the pain and guilt associated with these unspoken feelings.\n\nWhile it touches on personal insecurity, it is also a reflection on how past loves can quietly overshadow current relationships. Fans have connected the lyrics to Billie’s rumored relationships, making this one of the more candid and raw tracks from the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish/_/WILDFLOWER\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
