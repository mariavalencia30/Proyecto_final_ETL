The track was unveiled as track 14 on UTOPIA via its tracklist shared on July 27, 2023. Two years previous to its release, a snippet of this song surfaced and was dubbed by fans as “LAST TIME” & “HIDE MINE”.\n\nThe beat switches are symbolically in line with a skewed sense of thought, as they’re random and drastically apart from each other. The schizophrenic-like soundscape is further reinforced by Travis' frequent changes in his flow, and jarring lyrics that even mention Kanye West’s 2024 United States presidential campaign. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/SKITZO\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
