While talking about the song on the red carpet of the 59th Grammy Awards, Derulo said;\n\n\"I never believe in forcing a collaboration. You know, I’m a fan of both of theirs and I thought that they fit the track perfectly. It’s one of those ones that’ll get you up and doing your thing. I feel like it’s gonna stick out on the radio. There’s nothing that sounds like it.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Derulo/_/Swalla+(feat.+Nicki+Minaj+&+Ty+Dolla+$ign)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
