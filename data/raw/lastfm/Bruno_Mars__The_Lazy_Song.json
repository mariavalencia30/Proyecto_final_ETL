      "content": "\"The Lazy Song\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars for his debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010). It was serviced to contemporary hit radios in the United States on February 15, 2011, as the album's third single by Atlantic and Elektra.\n\nDevelopment of \"The Lazy Song\" began while Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine were hanging around the studio and didn't feel like working. The trio, produced the track under their alias, the Smeezingtons, and wrote the song in collaboration with singer-songwriter K'naan. Musically, \"The Lazy Song\" has been described as borrowing \"heavily from roots reggae\" and has been compared to the reggae style of Jason Mraz, while lyrically it is an anthem to laziness.\n\n\"The Lazy Song\" reached number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, while it topped the charts in Denmark and in the United Kingdom. It charted on most markets within the top five. Cameron Duddy and Mars directed the accompanying music video, in which Mars hangs out with five dancers with monkey masks while jest around in his underwear. It was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), five times by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and four times by Music Canada (MC), respectively. It was one of the best selling digital singles of 2011 with sales of 6.5 million copies.\n\nMars sang \"The Lazy Song\" on the television show American Idol and performed it during The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2010–12), the Hooligans in Wondaland Tour (2011), and occasionally on The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013–14). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars/_/The+Lazy+Song\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
