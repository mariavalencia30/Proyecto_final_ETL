      "content": "“Close To You” is the second single from Gracie Abrams' sophomore studio album, The Secret Of Us.\n\nServing as the final and bonus track on the album, Gracie said the song was never meant to be a part of The Secret Of Us, as it was from a different time entirely, but she added the track after years of fans begging for its release.\n\n“Close To You“ first appeared as a snippet on Instagram in September 2017 and teased again in March 2018.\n\nAfter performing the song live at an acoustic session in Toronto, “Close To You” was released exclusively on vinyl alongside the album’s lead single, “Risk”, on May 31, 2024. On June 4, Gracie announced it would come to streaming on June 7, 2024.\n\n“i wrote Close To You seven years ago and we made a demo that i posted 20 seconds of and you somehow cared about it enough for us to revisit the song seven years later. Close To You was not initially a part of TSOU — it’s from a different time entirely, we had finished the whole record top to bottom, but i heard you loud and clear. consider this one a bonus track pre-deluxe??“ — via Instagram\n\n“After seven years of sitting with the ‘Close To You’ demo, it finally felt right to rework and include on this album. I’m really grateful for the encouragement from everyone online who let me know they still want to hear song after all this time — it makes me want to dance with them, and I can’t wait till we get to do that.“ — via Rolling Stone\n\nDuring the tracking week ending June 22, 2024, the song debuted at #49 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song marks her first appearance on the chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gracie+Abrams/_/Close+to+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
