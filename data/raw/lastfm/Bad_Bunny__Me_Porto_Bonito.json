A reggaeton genre that emerged in the late 1980s in Puerto Rico, perreo is a style of dance and party music focusing on moving the hips (similar to twerking). In 2020, Bad Bunny recorded a track, \"Yo Perreo Sola,\" about a woman dancing the perreo alone. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Bunny/_/Me+Porto+Bonito\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
