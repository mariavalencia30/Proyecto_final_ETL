Shooting him was bittersweet, as it was one of the happiest days of my life, but on the second day of the shoot, my country Ukraine was invaded, so you can imagine the insane emotions we had while shooting. Me and my team from Ukraine poured so much love into this video, and you can see it on screen. It will be a music video I will never forget and now I can happily retire.\"\n\n—via Pitchfork <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/_/As+It+Was\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
