      "content": "“Starboy” is The Weeknd’s realization of his mega-stardom. Transforming from mysterious Canadian act to Billboard mainstay. Abel has come a long way, but with negative consequences in his journey to the top, he has developed mixed feelings towards fame.\n\n“Starboy” potentially marks a new era for The Weeknd. On the release date of the song, Abel posted an Instagram picture with the caption “r.i.p ‘@abelxo,’” marking the turn of his character and sound.\n\nThe song features production from French electronic duo Daft Punk, marking the first collaboration between The Weeknd and Daft Punk, and the latter’s first single since “Give Life Back To Music” was released in early-2014. A month before release Abel and Daft Punk had spent time together in the studio, and it was obviously so fruitful he decided to make one of their collaborations the album’s lead single.\n\n“Starboy” is the title track and lead single from The Weeknd’s third studio album, released on November 25th, 2016. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd/_/Starboy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
