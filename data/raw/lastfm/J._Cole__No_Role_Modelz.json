      "content": "​J. Cole believes that shallow, materialistic “L.A. hoes” got that way because their only role models were talentless reality TV stars. But Cole also had no role models growing up, so what does that make him? A conflicted man who indulges in empty lust even though he knows it doesn’t make him happy.\n\n“No Role Modelz” was already a fan favorite on Cole’s tour before being released as the fourth single from his third album, 2014 Forest Hills Drive. The “fuck Hollywood” theme of the album, which traces his own rise and response to fame, is particularly clear in this song’s lyrics.\n\nThe song’s hook interpolates Project Pat’s 2001 hit “Don’t Save Her,” and the track was produced by Phonix Beats and J. Cole. A clip of a speech by President George W. Bush is featured in an interlude before the song’s bridge. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/J.+Cole/_/No+Role+Modelz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
