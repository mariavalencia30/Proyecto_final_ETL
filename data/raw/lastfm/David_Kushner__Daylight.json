      "content": "After realizing he could sing after finishing 12th grade, David Kushner began writing songs with a close friend while living in Florida. He played the guitar and taught music to himself. Eventually, Kushner worked with a vocal coach and started writing songs he believed \"will speak to people\". He eventually released the singles \"Miserable Man\" and \"Mr. Forgettable\", which preceded his debut extended play Footprints I Found.\n\nKushner wrote the song \"Daylight\" with Hayden Robert Huders, Jeremy Fedryk, and John Bruce Williams. Miserable Music Group released it as a single on April 14, 2023. Kushner described his inspiration for the song: \"With my song 'Daylight,' I aim to convey the paradoxical desire for something that is simultaneously harmful to oneself, using elements of light and darkness, the lyrics 'Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time you and I drink the poison from the same vine' encapsulate this concept.\" One of the fastest songs he ever wrote, its story is based on biblical allusions he found inspirational as a child.\n\nLuke Shaw and Landon Juern directed the music video for \"Daylight\", which was released alongside it, and features a pensive and soulful Kushner at a woodland church, along with the elements fire, water, air, and ash. The song serves as the second single from his upcoming debut studio album. It debuted at number six on the Spotify Global chart dated April 14, with 4,473,193 streams.  \"Daylight\" is projected to debut at number two on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Kushner's first top-10 single.\n\nThe song released into negative reviews on RYM and got featured on BadSongsoftheDay, an Instagram account. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Kushner/_/Daylight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
