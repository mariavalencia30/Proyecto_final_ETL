This viral trend, combined with Donald Glover's shoutout at the 2017 Golden Globes, would help its commercial performance and cause the song to spike into the top ten and later peak at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for the week of January 21, 2017, making it the first number one single for both Migos and Lil Uzi Vert. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Migos/_/Bad+and+Boujee+(feat.+Lil+Uzi+Vert)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
