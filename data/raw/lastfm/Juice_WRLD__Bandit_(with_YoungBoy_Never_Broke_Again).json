      "content": "“Bandit” is the first collaboration between Juice WRLD and Louisiana rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again. Juice describes his experiences with MDMA and boasts about his relationship with a “bad girl” who is a notorious heartbreaker. Meanwhile, YoungBoy discusses his hood origins and marksmanship with weapons.\n\nAlthough the song originally leaked online in June of 2018, with unfinished mastering and a missing verse, snippets from December of 2018 and February of 2019 also surfaced, leading to theories that it was a throwaway from Juice’s sophomore album, Death Race for Love, released in March 2019.\n\nIn September 2019, rumors of a feature from YoungBoy began circulating, as a snippet containing some of his vocals appeared online. Teasers of the music video also featured the two artists on boats in a Louisiana lake, seemingly confirming that an accompanying video was on its way. Two days before its release, Juice officially announced the song on social media. On October 4, 2019, the single was released on all platforms, along with a music video directed by Cole Bennett. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+WRLD/_/Bandit+(with+YoungBoy+Never+Broke+Again)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
