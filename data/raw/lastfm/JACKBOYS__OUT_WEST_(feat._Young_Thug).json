      "content": "After collaborating on Young Thug’s “Hop Off a Jet” just one week earlier, Travis Scott enlists his frequent collaborator for another energetic track. On the flute-heavy track, Travis describes the loyalty that his Cactus Jack Records gang shares, while Thug crudely describes his sexual activities.\n\nThe song’s title refers to Los Angeles, California, not to the age of the American Frontier, which lasted from the early 1600s to the early 1900s. While Travis was born in Houston and Thug was born in Atlanta, both have lived in Los Angeles during times throughout the last few years and currently reside there. The two rappers use brash lyricism, an exotic melody and a hypnotizing beat to portray themselves as modern outlaws.\n\nOn March 20, 2020, the song’s official music video was released. It features Travis and Thug alongside Travis' Cactus Jack members Don Toliver, Sheck Wes, Luxury Tax, and Chase B, and Thug’s YSL members Yung Kayo and Young Jordan. The video also features a cameo appearance from 21 Savage, a frequent collaborator of both Travis and Thug.\n\nIn an interview with Our Generation Music, Buddah Bless, who produced the track, said that he made about 300 beats using a keyboard he had just bought. “OUT WEST” was one of the beats he made in that time, along with NBA YoungBoy’s “Make No Sense” and Chris Brown’s “Heat.”\n\nAlthough there are many unreleased collaborations between the two, “OUT WEST” marks their twelfth to be officially released, following the songs listed below:\n\n- Travis, “Mamacita” & “Skyfall” (Aug. 2014)\n- Travis, “Nothing But Net” (Jan. 2015)\n- Travis, “Maria I’m Drunk” (Sep. 2015)\n- Both, “pick up the phone” (Jun. 2016)\n- Thug, “Floyd Mayweather” (Aug. 2016)\n- Thug, Me or Us (Remix) (Dec. 2017)\n- Metro Boomin, “Up to Something” (Nov. 2018)\n- Thug, “The London” (May 2019)\n- Thug, “Hot (Remix)” (Oct. 2019)\n- Thug, “Hop Off a Jet” (Dec. 2019)\n\n“OUT WEST” debuted at #38 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the chart week of January 11th, 2020. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/JACKBOYS/_/OUT+WEST+(feat.+Young+Thug)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
