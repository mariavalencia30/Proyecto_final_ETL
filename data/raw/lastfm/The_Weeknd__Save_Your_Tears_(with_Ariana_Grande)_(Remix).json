      "content": "\"Save Your Tears\" is a song by Canadian singer the Weeknd for his fourth studio album After Hours (2020). The Weeknd wrote and produced the song with producers Max Martin and Oscar Holter, with Belly and Jason Quenneville receiving additional writing credits. The record was met with universal acclaim.\n\nThe remix, a collaboration with American singer Ariana Grande, was released on April 22, 2021 with an accompanying animated music video. The song marks the third collaboration between The Weeknd and Grande, after 2020's \"Off the Table\" and 2014's \"Love Me Harder\".\n\nThe remix garnered universal acclaim. Billboard staff member Katie Atkinson complimented, “Ariana Grande brings her ethereal vocals to the song”. “The Weeknd and Ariana Grande’s third collaboration will have you smiling all year long”, Billboard journalist Gab Ginsberg exclaimed Natalia Barr of Wallstreet Journal hailed it as one of the best new pop records, “the two singers have reunited on an updated piece from the Weeknd’s new wave-inspired album from last year, After Hours. Grande adds her sultry vocals to the song’s second verse and chorus”. NME columnist Will Lavin noted, “Grande adds a fresh and husky verse of her own to the remix”. Monica Sisavat from PopSugar described the remix as pure perfection, “Let's just say their voices together are just chef's kiss.”  “The pair’s vocals intermingle on the wistful, synth-laden track as they harmonize,” Rolling Stone editor Althea Legaspi stated. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd/_/Save+Your+Tears+(with+Ariana+Grande)+(Remix)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
