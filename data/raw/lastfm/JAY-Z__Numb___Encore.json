Linkin Park’s verses take the opposite perspective, reflecting on how sometimes you’re not good enough and can’t make everyone happy.\n\n\"The bottom line was we wanted to perform a show together, so [you might ask] why we would spend all that time in the studio. It’s because when you hear a song in its studio form and you’ve got a good-quality copy of the song, then you know how it should sound when you go play it live. If you just go jam it out, you might never know the potential of the quality you’re trying to achieve.\"\n\n– Mike Shinoda, MTV News\n\n“Numb / Encore” was certified 3x platinum by the RIAA on December 13, 2017. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/JAY-Z/_/Numb+%2F+Encore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
