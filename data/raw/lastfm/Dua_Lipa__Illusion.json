      "content": "“Illusion” is a song by English-Albanian singer Dua Lipa. It was released through Warner Records on 11 April 2024, as the third single and the seventh track from her third studio album, Radical Optimism.\n\nOn “Illusion”, Dua Lipa rejects falling for an “illusion”, a personality façade created by someone trying to deceive her, despite being able to see through this, she is choosing to see the situation as amusing.\n\nThe music video was filmed at the Piscina Municipal de Montjuïc in Barcelona, which hosted diving and water polo events at the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\n“Illusion was a song where I felt like lyrically, I got this radical optimism. I felt very strong in the moment when I was writing that song, because it was really seeing past someone’s bullshit, I guess, for lack of a better word. And understanding it for what it is and just entertaining it for the hell of it, even though you see what’s happening. When Kevin and Danny came together and it was the live drums and the synths and the big music breakdown, in my head the big dance moment, when all those came together it was just a feeling.”\n(—via Dua Lipa’s NME Interview) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/_/Illusion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
