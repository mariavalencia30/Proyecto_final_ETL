Two months later, on June 30, 2020, Drake and Khaled both posted pictures of owls—the symbol of Drake’s OVO Sound imprint—teasing a possible collaboration. On July 15, 2020, Khaled posted the song’s release date and cover art on his Instagram account. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Khaled/_/GREECE+(feat.+Drake)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
