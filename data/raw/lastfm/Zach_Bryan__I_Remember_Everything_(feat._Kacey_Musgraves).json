      "content": "\"I Remember Everything\" is a song by American singer Zach Bryan featuring country music artist Kacey Musgraves. It was released on August 25, 2023, as track eleven from his fourth studio album Zach Bryan.\n\nWhile putting finishing touches on the song, Bryan shared the title and a short preview on June 14, 2023. Initial confusion sparked by the title of an John Prine ballad of the same name led Bryan to explain that he wanted to change the song title at first but ultimately went with it as is since a change did not \"sit right\" with him. He played an acoustic rendition of the track on his Instagram on July 25.\n\n\"I Remember Everything\", a \"sparse ballad\" about \"love and life\", reflects a conversation between a man and a woman who used to love each other. While the protagonists were widely noted as being in a relationship, the song could as well talk about a \"past summer beach romance\" in an \"'88 Ford\", as suggested by Rolling Stone. The couple in question reaffirms the authenticity of their past feelings and experiences through their lyrics. The couple shares \"tragically different perspectives\" on alcohol and its role throughout their relationship. While Bryan reminisces on the upside of their relationship, Musgraves recalls more negative connotations, accusing him of not being the man he once swore to be. Accompanied by just an acoustic guitar and a set of strings towards the end, Bryan croons \"painstakingly simple yet poetic\" lines that Musgraves opposes as his counterpart. Their energy on the track together was described as \"a gale\", combining Musgraves' signature elements of \"yearning\" and Bryan's \"reputation on strong songwriting\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Zach+Bryan/_/I+Remember+Everything+(feat.+Kacey+Musgraves)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
